To create a new template:

1. Right click on Templates at the required location at the project tree and choose  New Template file from the context menu.
2. Write the template at the working area
3. On Save - type in the template name and choose its type (Target Ext. property ) among: [Broadway flow](/articles/19_Broadway/02a_broadway_flow_overview.md), [Broadway actor](/articles/19_Broadway/03_broadway_actor.md), [graphit](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/17_Graphit/01_graphit_overview.md), java, [data catalog](/articles/33_data_catalog/01_data_catalog_overview.md). 

Once it created the template appears at the location it has been created at and appears, as available to be used, in the template list, when creating new objects.



Editing of a template is done by opening it from the Fabric studio project tree. Editing changes take affect on objects that will be created after that. Editing or Deletion of a template do not affect on existing objects.
