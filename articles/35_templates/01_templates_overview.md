# Templates Overview

Templates are ready made Fabric objects that can be used throughout a project rather than having to build them from scratch. 

* Having a defined structure already built saves time and offers increased efficiency when creating objects.
* Using templates can reduce implementation mistakes as they adopt and embed the right methodologies and Fabric best practices.

Templates can be used for various purposes in Broadway Flows and Actors, Java files, Graphit and the Data Catalog.

Fabric Templates support placeholders usage for smoother and smarter reuse. When creating an object based on a template, the user populates the templateâ€™s placeholders so that the new object is auto-generated with this data, already embedded inside the created object.

The integrated Templates engine has powerful capabilities such as iteration over lists, conditions and lookup expressions. 

While templates can be useful for many scenarios, TDM is a good example where this capability is heavily been in use. TDM uses Broadway flows for transferring data from LU tables into target tables. Instead of creating manually a flow for each of the LU tables, that fulfill similar task of getting its data and load it to the target, templates are used.
