## 1.3 Fabric's SonarQube Customized Library

K2view provides a new plugin which contains Fabric customized rules. It detects bugs & code smells in the Fabric implementation code. 

The Fabric library includes alerts for Java code best practices as well as Fabric specific best practices. This customisation layer was built based on the “Fabric – Implementation Best Practices” document.

Scanning the project using the customized plugin will:

- Identify potential issues in the implementation
- Provide an explanation about the issue 
- Suggest the relevant change(s) 
- Provide an estimation on the required development time for the change(s)
