# Flows

A Flow is an entity that defines the sequence of actions to be executed in order to fulfill a specific DPM request type. For example, the actions to fulfil the request to “get my data” or “forget me”. 
Flow is the main component in the DPM request definition and can be viewed as the “brain” of a DPM request. 

A Flow is composed of <i>Stages</i>, and Stages include one or multiple tasks. 

Once a Flow’s configuration is complete, it can be linked to a DPM Activity. From that point on, any time a customer request for this DPM Activity is processed, the stages and tasks defined in this Flow are followed.  

The Admin can view the list of existing flows by selecting the “Flows List” menu option at the left frame of the application screen. 
The right frame displays the details for each listed flow and allows the Admin to search for a specific Flow, review any particular flow, and create a new Flow.

## Flows List

The list of existing Flows provides the high-level information about each of the configured Flows. 

 ![image](/articles/DPM/images/Figure_4_Flows_List_screen.png)

In this screen, the information about each Flow includes: 

- Name: The Flow name.
- Description: describes the purpose of this Flow.
- Version: A Flow may have more than one version. All versions are presented.
- Status: A Flow is created as a Draft, and then changed into Completed. Only Draft Flows can be altered.

Only Completed Flows can be assigned to Activities.

- Regulation/Activity: List of all the Activities that uses this Flow.
- Actions: provide the option to delete a Flow. 

The following sections provide some additional information about the options and data in the “Flows List” screen. 

### View Flow Details

To view the details of a specific Flow, select the table line of the Flow, and the Flow details screen will be presented.

### Delete a Flow

To delete a Flow, click on the delete (x) button under the Action column. Only Flows that are not linked to an Activity can be deleted.

### Flow Status

Flow Status - When a new Flow is created, its status is defined as Draft. In this status, the DPM Administrator can perform any configuration on this Flow, such as creating new stages, adding new tasks, etc.  
Once the Administrator completes the configuration, the Flow is marked as Completed. Marking the Flow as Completed blocks further changes to the Flow. Afterward, this Flow can be linked to a DPM Activity so that it can be executed as part of a DPM fulfillment process. The same Flow can be linked to more than one DPM Activity. 

### Flow Version

Any Flow can have multiple versions. A new version should be created when a change to an existing Completed Flow is required. The version number is determined by the Administrator when the new Flow version is created. Creating a new version of a Flow is described in the sub-chapter about the “Flow Details” screen.

### Create New Flow

The Administrator can create a new Flow by using the “Add a Flow” button on the top-right corner of the screen. 
The Administrator is then prompted to define the Flow name, version, and description:

<p>The Flow version field is optional, and the system will assign it automatically if it is not filled in by the user. The logic for the automatic version number allocation is as follows:</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no other Flow with the same name, the system will automatically set it to 1.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a Flow with the same name, the system will set the Flow version of the new Flow to one higher than the version number of the Flow with the same name.</p>
<p>The system will not allow the creation of two Flows with the same name and the same version.</p>

Once the Flow information is defined and the new Flow is saved, the system presents the Flow Editing screen, where the Administrator can add Stages and Tasks under those Stages. 
The Flow name and the Flow description can be updated at any  time, by using the edit icon next to the Flow name.

## Flow Level Actions

The set of icons next to the Flow name are Activities at Flow level:

At the upper-right corner of the Flow screen, the system shows general Flow information:

<td width="100">
<p>(x business Hours)</p>
</td>
<td width="800">
<p>This indicates the total number of hours that the Flow is expected to take, according to the deadline information of all its Tasks. The unit of the information can be changed by configuration from Hours to Minutes. Note that changing the configuration from Hours to Minutes alters the expected duration of the Flow, and not only the units. For example: a Task with the deadline set to 1 would be considered as 1 hour long when the configuration is &ldquo;Hours&rdquo; and as 1 minute long when the configuration is set to &ldquo;Minutes&rdquo;. The option of &ldquo;Minutes&rdquo; is usually utilized for testing purposes, when the tester would like to have the Flows executed faster.</p>

</table>

### Add a Stage

Use the  ![image](/articles/DPM/images/Figure_8a_plus_icon.png) button on the left side of the Flow screen in order to add a new Stage. As a result, the user is prompted to define the Stage name and description:

<td width="30">

</table>

Saving the new Stage will open the screen to define tasks in this stage.

As long as the Flow is not marked  Completed, additional Stages can be added, and Tasks under them can be added or modified.
