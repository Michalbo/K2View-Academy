# Environment Window - Environment Summary Section

The Environment Summary section on the right side of the Environment window displays the summary information about the environments and the execution statistics of the last month:

- Processed Entities - number of entities processed by task executions for environment during the last month. For example- if ENV1 had 2 tasks executions during last month- one for copy of 20 entities and another task execution for copy of 100 entities, then number of processed entities for environment = 120 (20 + 100).

- Tasks - number of active tasks on the environment per [task execution status]: **Active** or **On hold**. 
- Testers -  number of testers that are [attached to a role] of the environment.
- Execution Status - number of task executions on environment during last month per execution status.
