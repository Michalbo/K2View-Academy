# Business Entity Windows 

A [Business Entity](/articles/TDM/tdm_overview/03_business_entity_overview.md) (BE) represents the main entity of the selected data to be provisioned by TDM. A Business Entity can have multiple [LUs](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/Academy_6.4_TDM/articles/TDM/tdm_overview/(/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md)) with a flat or a hierarchical structure. For example, a Customer Business Entity consists of Customer Care, Billing, Ordering and Usage LUs. Each LU can be attached to multiple BEs.
