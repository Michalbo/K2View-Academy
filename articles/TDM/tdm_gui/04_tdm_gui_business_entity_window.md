# Business Entity Windows 

A [Business Entity](/articles/TDM/tdm_overview/03_business_entity_overview.md) (BE) represents the main entity of the data to be provisioned by TDM. A Business Entity can have multiple [LUs](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/Academy_6.4_TDM/articles/TDM/tdm_overview/(/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md)) with a flat or  hierarchical structure. For example, a Customer Business Entity can have Customer Care, Billing, Ordering and Usage LUs. Each LU can be attached to multiple BEs.

## Business Entities Window

The **Business Entities** window displays a list of all Business Entities defined in the TDM. 

-   To create a new Business Entity, Admin users click the **New Business Entity** icon.

-   To open a selected Business Entity, click the **Name** value of the Business Entity.

## Business Entity Window    

The Business Entity window displays information about a selected Business Entity. It has three main sections:

- Business Entity Name and Description fields.
